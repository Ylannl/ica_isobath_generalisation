### Abstract (in bullets)

-------
+ Short introduction on navigational charts
+ why they are critical (compared to topographic maps)
+ why generalisation is important in these charts
+ the four constraints (context)
-------
+ properties of line- and surface based approaches
+ information bias between only accounting for lines or soundings
+ goal of integrated approach (ideal)
+ basis is the surface base approach: generalises the surface without any information on the outcome
-------
+ linking mechanism: triangle region graph
+ geometry of trg
+ properties of trg
-------
+ generalisation approach
+ continue generalisation, up to minimum legibility requirements
+ goal is having a legible chart, safe by definition, morphology represented as good as possible
+ simple rule-based process
+ in theory could use information on both survey-level (accuracy/lineage/direction) and cartographic level (constraints)
+ generalisation mechanism is smoothing the surface, effectively smoothing lines, removing pits, enlarging peaks etc.
-------
+ proof of concept: results
+ in relation to VSBA, maintain more morphology
+ especially effective on large scale
+ need more radical generalisation operators on small scales
-------
+ the advantages of an integrated approach, best of line- and surface-based
+ now, develop better metrics suitable for the constraints and more complex operators
+ beyond smoothing the surface
+ other evaluation model: optimisation, or using more of the available structure (~hierarchical)
+ do not underestimate the cartographer's eye, especially in these critical applications
+ containment versus adjacency
